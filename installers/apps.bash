# General development stuff:
    
    sudo apt-get -y install vim git tree httpie terminator silversearcher-ag
    
    # VIM - Text editor on steroids
    # Git - Version control system
    # tree - Structured alternative to ls command
    # httpie - Instead of curl for REST API work
    # Terminator - Terminal emulator with split windows feature
    # silversearcher-ag - Search for a keyword in ALL files in given directory


# Python development related:
   
    sudo pip install flake8 coverage ipython pexpect
    
    # flake8 - for PEP8 syntax compliance
    # coverage - for unit testing reports
    # ipython - Better than default python shell that keeps command history
    # pexpect - ipython dependency

# Handy stuff in general:
    sudo apt-get -y install cmatrix redshift
    
    # cmatrix - Cool matrix animation
    # redshift - Screen light dimmer at night
